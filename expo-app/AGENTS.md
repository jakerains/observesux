# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/`: Expo Router screens and layouts (tabs live under `app/(tabs)/`).
- `components/`: Reusable UI and dashboard widgets (e.g., `components/widgets/`).
- `lib/`: Data fetching, hooks, API configuration, and shared types.
- `constants/`: Theme and app-wide constants.
- `assets/`: Images, icons, and other static assets.
- `ios/`, `android/`: Native projects generated by `pnpm prebuild`.
- Root config: `app.json`, `eas.json`, `metro.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm start`: Start the Expo dev server.
- `pnpm ios`: Run on the iOS Simulator (requires Xcode).
- `pnpm android`: Run on the Android Emulator.
- `pnpm prebuild`: Generate native iOS/Android projects.
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint across the project.
- `pnpm typecheck`: Run TypeScript type checking.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React Native. Follow existing formatting: 2-space indentation, single quotes, no semicolons.
- Components use `PascalCase` filenames (e.g., `DashboardCard.tsx`); hooks use `useSomething.ts`.
- Prefer path aliases via `@/` for imports from the project root (e.g., `@/lib/api`).
- Keep Tailwind or className strings readable when present; avoid long, unbroken class lists.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test runner is configured yet.
- Validate changes with `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and manual QA in `pnpm start`.
- For UI changes, verify on both iOS and Android if possible.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) as seen in the git history.
- PRs should include a short summary, testing notes, and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Link relevant issues or tasks when available.

## Configuration & Data
- API base URL and endpoints live in `lib/api.ts` (development vs production).
- EAS build profiles are defined in `eas.json`; app metadata in `app.json`.
- Keep secrets out of the repo; use local environment configuration as needed.

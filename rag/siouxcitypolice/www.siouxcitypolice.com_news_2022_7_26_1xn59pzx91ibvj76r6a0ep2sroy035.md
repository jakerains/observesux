Administration with the Sioux City Police Department traveled to Chicago Illinois this past weekend to seek continued accreditation through the Commission on the Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies. CALEA® Accreditation serves as the _International Gold Standard for Public Safety Agencies_. And establishes that the SCPD as an agency that seeks the highest level of law enforcement standards and practices.

The process of CALEA Accreditation begins with a rigorous self-assessment, requiring a review of policies, practices, and processes against internationally accepted public safety standards. This is followed with an assessment by independent assessors with significant public safety experience. Additionally, public feedback is received to promote community trust and engagement, and structured interviews are conducted with select agency personnel and others with knowledge to assess the agency’s effectiveness and overall service delivery capacities. The decision to accredit is rendered by a governing body of twenty-one Commissioners following a public hearing and review of all reporting documentation.

During the public hearing in Chicago, the SCPD was awarded their 9th accreditation with CALEA. This award remains in effect for four years and the agency retains all privileges associated with this status during that period.

CALEA Accreditation is a continuous process and serves as the foundation for a successful, well managed, transparent, community-focused public safety agency. To this end, an agency must maintain its accredited status by always remaining in compliance with CALEA standards.

CALEA congratulated the Sioux City Police Department for demonstrating a commitment to professional excellence through accreditation. The CALEA Accreditation indices are the _Marks of Professional Excellence_. The Sioux City Police Department is proud to stand among the Sioux City Fire Department, Sioux City Fire EMS Division, and the Woodbury County Communications Center as another accredited entity that continues to serve our community with honor and dedication. The fact that accreditation is embraced by all these public safety entities is proof of our commitment to providing the highest level of professional public service to our citizens.

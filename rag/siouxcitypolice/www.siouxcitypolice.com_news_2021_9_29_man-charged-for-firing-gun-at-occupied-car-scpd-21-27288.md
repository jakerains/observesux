On Sept. 16 at 5:22 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department responded to a report of shots being fired in the 700 block of Center St.

Officers located a vehicle involved in the shooting a short distance away and stopped it at W 4th St and Wesley Park Way. Officers detained the two men inside.

The investigation determined that the two men detained followed another car to a residence in the 700 block of Center St. and the passenger fired a shot at the car that was occupied by an adult male, an adult female, a 6-year-old child, and a 4-year-old child. No one was injured in the shooting.

Detectives charged 18-year-old Jalond J. Hills of Sioux City with terrorism and going armed with intent.

The driver of the car, 19-year-old Charles J. Sully of Sioux City, was charged with failure to provide financial security (no car insurance) but was not charged with the shooting as it appeared he was not aware of Hills intent to shoot at the other car.

The cause of the dispute that led to this shooting is still under investigation.

_Any arrest/charge noted in this report should be considered merely an accusation. Any defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty._

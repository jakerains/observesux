The Sioux City Police Department wishes to announce the addition of a new resource on their website.  The Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies, CALEA, has launched a public comment web portal.  The SCPD has built a link to this site on the SCPD website under the Resources Tab called CALEA Portal.

CALEA maintains an access portal which allows for public comment and feedback.  Access is provided as an opportunity for comments, commendations, and other information regarding the SCPD’s quality of service or other information relevant to the department’s accreditation process.  This comment portal replaces the need for CALEA to hold public hearings every 4 years.  CALEA can now receive public comments about the SCPD year-round instead of just on one day, quadrennially.

These comments can be in the form of commendations or concerns. The overall intent of the accreditation process is to provide the Sioux City Police Department with information to support continuous improvement, as well as foster the pursuit of professional excellence.

CALEA is not an investigatory body and subsequently the public portal should not be used to submit information for such purposes. Citizens wishing to file formal complaints against an officer should contact the Sioux City Police Department’s Professional Standards section at 712-279-6356.

There will be no response other than acknowledgement to submissions; however, the information will be considered in context to its relevancy to compliance with standards and the tenets of CALEA Accreditation of the SCPD.

The Sioux City Police Department has been continuously accredited by CALEA since 1995 and was re-accredited in July 2022 for the 9th time.

The CALEA public portal can be found at www.siouxcitypolice.com/calea-portal

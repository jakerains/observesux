**Update on Oct. 1 at 3:25 p.m.** \- On Oct. 1 at about 2:00 p.m., a 17-year-old juvenile male of Sioux City surrendered himself to detectives at the Sioux City Police Department and was charged with attempted murder, willful injury, intimidation with a weapon, going armed with intent, and trafficking in stolen firearms.

The juvenile was charged as an adult and taken to the Woodbury County Juvenile Detention Center.

**Update on Sept. 27 at 2:40 p.m.** \- Detectives with the Sioux City Police Department have requested that the Woodbury County Attorney’s Office drop charges filed on Sept. 25 against Eric-Jahim Word in connection to the shooting in the 200 block of Nebraska St. that left one man hospitalized.

Word’s arrest was based on available information at that time. As detectives continued their investigation, new information was discovered indicating that a witness intentionally misidentified Word as the person who fired the shots. Word was involved in the incident and fled before officers arrived.

The correct suspect has been identified and detectives are working with the County Attorney’s Office to file appropriate charges against that person.

**Release on Sept. 25 at 10:30 a.m.** – Detectives have arrested 19-year-old Eric-Jahim E. Word of Sioux City and charged him with attempted murder, going armed with intent, and trafficking in stolen weapons during the overnight hours for the shooting that occurred in the 200 block of Nebraska St. _(NOTE: Charges against Eric-Jahim Word were dropped after it was found a witness had intentionally misidentified him as the shooter. A 17-year-old juvenile male was charged on Oct. 1 for this act.)_

Also charged in connection to this incident were 39-year-old Joy-Esther A. Scott of Sioux City and 23-year-old Miracle J. Walls of Sioux City both of whom were charged with 2nd degree burglary.

Word, Scott, Walls and _a 17-year-old juvenile male_ had been in vehicles that were following another adult female they had an on-going feud with. They eventually blocked her path on an access road in the 200 block of Nebraska St.

With the car stopped, Scott and Walls opened the woman’s car door and began to assault her causing her minor injuries.

It was at this time that the brother of the woman being assault arrived as she had been on the phone with him. He approached Word, Walls, and Scott to attempted to stop them.

_The 17-year-old juvenile male_ produced a handgun and shot the brother twice, once in the back and once in the chest.

The male victim remains at MercyOne due to his injuries.

**ORIGINAL RELEASE on Sept. 24 at 6:00 p.m.** \- On Sept. 24 at 3:10 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department received a report of a shots being fired in the 200 block of Nebraska St.

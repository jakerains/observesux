On September 23 at around 8:30 am, students at West High School in Sioux City notified school administration and the Sioux City Police Department of a concerning post on social media showing ammunition and a message that seemed like a veiled threat.

Out of an abundance of caution, the Sioux City Community School District implemented security measures to ensure the safety of students.

Officers worked closely with the school to keep students safe and fully investigate the matter.

The student who made the post was identified and located. The juvenile-male is being questioned on the matter.

As the post was not a direct threat, the department is referring this incident to the County Attorney’s Office for consideration for charges.

Students that reported the post are to be commended for reporting a concerning post that indicated a possible threat to safety.

We also encourage parents to speak to their children about posting messages and images to social media that may cause alarm.

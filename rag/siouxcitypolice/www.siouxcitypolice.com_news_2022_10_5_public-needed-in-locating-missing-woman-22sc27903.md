The Sioux City Police Department is asking for the public’s help in locating 36-year-old Brenda Payer of Sioux City.

Her family reported that they last had contact with her on Thursday September 29 when she parked her van in the McDonalds parking lot in the 700 block of Hamilton Blvd. Since then, her friends and family have been unable to contact her.

Payer is a native American woman with black hair and brown eyes, she is 5 foot 8 inches tall, and weighs 170 pounds.

We do not suspect foul play but are concerned for her mental health as she may be in crisis. We would like to locate her to ensure she is safe.

Anyone with information on her whereabouts is encouraged to contact the department at 279-6960. We are also encouraging Brenda to contact us to let us know if she needs assistance.

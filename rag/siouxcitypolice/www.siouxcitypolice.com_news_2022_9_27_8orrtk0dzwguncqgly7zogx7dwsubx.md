On September 27 at 3:58 am, the Sioux City Police Department received a report of several shots being fired in the area of the 5000 block of Lorraine Ave.

Officers responding to the incident located a vehicle believed to have been involved in the shooting. When officers attempted to stop the car, the driver failed to yield and tried to elude officers.

Officers pursued the car and during the chase, a passenger got out and fled on foot in Sgt. Bluff. He was not apprehended and is described as a Hispanic male in his late teens or early twenties wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and black shorts.

The pursuit ended in Sgt. Bluff and the driver was taken into custody. Ammunition for a handgun was located in the vehicle.

Officers charged 19-year-old Jordan J. Hills of Sioux City with serious eluding. Hills also had warrants for his arrest on charges of probation violation pcs with intent to deliver, simple assault, and 3rd degree harassment.

The investigation into the shooting located a house that was struck by gunfire in the area. The occupant of the house that was struck provided limited cooperation with officers. It is believed that the occupant and the person suspected of firing at the house are known to each other. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation.

This is an on-going investigation and anyone with information on who the subject was that ran from officers on foot are encouraged to call the department at 279-6960.

The Sioux City Police Department was assisted by the Sgt. Bluff Police Department and the Woodbury County Sheriff’s Office.

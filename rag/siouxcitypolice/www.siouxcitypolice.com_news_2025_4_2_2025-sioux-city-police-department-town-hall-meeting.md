The Sioux City Police Department will host a Town Hall meeting on Tuesday, April 8 from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm at the Sioux City Public Museum, 607 4th Street.

This public meeting is an opportunity for the Department to discuss crime statistics, strategic planning, and partnerships. Attendees will also be able to discuss issues that they are experiencing in their neighborhood.

“The Sioux City Police Department is a successful agency because of our ability to partner with our citizens for positive results,” said Chief Rex Mueller, Chief of Police. “When the police and citizens actively communicate and engage in important dialogues, we become much more effective at making our community safer. These town hall meetings are just one way we keep our citizens informed of our progress and give their input as to how our resources are best used.”

The Town Hall will be streamed live on our Facebook page at [www.facebook.com/siouxcitypolice](http://www.facebook.com/siouxcitypolice).

## May 22, 2025 [Jeremy McClure](https://www.siouxcitypolice.com/news?author=5c6dc3cedb792698ae90a839)

The Sioux City Police Department has taken 34-year-old Juan Manuel Segovia of Sioux City into custody after a brief standoff at 912 21st Street on May 22, 2025.

Segovia had felony warrants for his arrest and was being sought by detectives when they saw him on the near-north side of the city at around 3:15 pm. Before he could be taken into custody, the detectives lost sight of him around the 900 block of 21st Street. It was soon determined that Segovia was at 912 21st Street.

A perimeter was established as Segovia is a known violent gang member who carries firearms. Officers attempted to call Segovia out of the house, but he refused to comply with those commands and would not communicate with officers. The SWAT Team was called out due to his history of violence and the potential of him having a firearm.

Once a search warrant for the house was obtained, and efforts to negotiate his peaceful surrender were exhausted, SWAT made entry into the house. Segovia was discovered hiding in the attic and surrendered once chemical agents were.

Segovia was assessed by medics for the chemical agent exposure but was not injured in the incident. No officers were hurt resolving this situation.

Segovia was booked into the Woodbury County Jail for two felony warrants for probation violation and a misdemeanor warrant for failure to comply with batterers education. No additional charges have been filed at this time but the investigation into Segovia is ongoing.

The Sioux City Police Department is dedicated to arresting violent felons and places the public’s safety as its highest priority. Efforts were made to resolve this matter peacefully. We are thankful that no one was injured and appreciate the neighborhood’s patience while we resolved this situation.

# [CALEA portal for public input created](https://www.siouxcitypolice.com/news/2023/6/21/calea-portal-for-public-input-created)

## June 21, 2023 [Jeremy McClure](https://www.siouxcitypolice.com/news?author=5c6dc3cedb792698ae90a839)

The Sioux City Police Department wishes to announce the addition of a new resource on their website.  The Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies, CALEA, has launched a public comment web portal.  The SCPD has built a link to this site on the SCPD website under the Resources Tab called CALEA Portal.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5759751cf85082ad8894f056/6d13ac6b-20bd-4569-a838-c8501bb34878/7032.jpg)

CALEA maintains an access portal which allows for public comment and feedback.  Access is provided as an opportunity for comments, commendations, and other information regarding the SCPD’s quality of service or other information relevant to the department’s accreditation process.  This comment portal replaces the need for CALEA to hold public hearings every 4 years.  CALEA can now receive public comments about the SCPD year-round instead of just on one day, quadrennially.

These comments can be in the form of commendations or concerns. The overall intent of the accreditation process is to provide the Sioux City Police Department with information to support continuous improvement, as well as foster the pursuit of professional excellence.

CALEA is not an investigatory body and subsequently the public portal should not be used to submit information for such purposes. Citizens wishing to file formal complaints against an officer should contact the Sioux City Police Department’s Professional Standards section at 712-279-6356.

There will be no response other than acknowledgement to submissions; however, the information will be considered in context to its relevancy to compliance with standards and the tenets of CALEA Accreditation of the SCPD.

The Sioux City Police Department has been continuously accredited by CALEA since 1995 and was re-accredited in July 2022 for the 9th time.

The CALEA public portal can be found at www.siouxcitypolice.com/calea-portal

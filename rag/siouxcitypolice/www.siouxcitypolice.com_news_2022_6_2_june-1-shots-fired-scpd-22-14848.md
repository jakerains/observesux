On June 1 at 5:55 p.m. the Sioux City Police Department received reports of shots being fired in the 600 block of Myrtle St.

Responding officers located an individual on scene who stated the incident started at a nearby business in the 1300 block of W. 4th St. with a physical altercation occurring between himself and two other males. The involved subjects then followed each other in their vehicles for a short distance before the passenger in the suspect vehicle shot at the victim’s vehicle. The suspects then fled the scene in their vehicle.

Officers located evidence on scene to confirm shots had been fired. No one was struck or injured during the incident.

The identity of the suspects is not known at this time, but initial information suggests that the male parties were acquainted with each other.

The person who fired the shots is described as a Hispanic or Native American male in his mid to late 20’s with a tattoo on his face. He was last seen in the passenger seat of a black, four door pickup, possibly a Chevrolet Silverado that was lifted and with a loud muffler being driven by a white male.

This is an on-going investigation. Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects is asked to call the Sioux City Police Department or Crime Stoppers at 258-TIPS (8477).

**_Any arrest/charge noted in this report should be considered merely an accusation. Any defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty._**

Since the placement of speed photo enforcement cameras on Hamilton Blvd. and Floyd Blvd., the Sioux City Police Department has seen a decrease in speed violations and accidents reported near the cameras.

Speed camera in the 3300 block of Hamilton Blvd.

The cameras were stationed in the 3300 block of Hamilton Blvd. and the 3000 block of Floyd Blvd. in May of 2022 but due to a technical issue, violations were not issued until July. However, monitoring of traffic data was available during that time.

When the camera on Hamilton Blvd. was put in place in May, 1.9% of cars passing it were over 10 mph of the posted speed limit. By the end of July, only 1.06% cars passing were in violation.

Accident data indicates a downward trend as well. Between Jan. 1, 2018, to June 10, 2022, between Stone Park Blvd and 36th St. on Hamilton there were approximately 2.26 accidents a month. For July and August 2022, that rate drop to approximately 1.5 accidents a month.

On Floyd Blvd between 28th St. and Outer Dr. for the same time periods, the accident rate dropped from .8 accidents a month to 0 reported accidents.

The technical issues with the cameras were corrected around July 12 and violations were issued starting at that time. Between that date and August 31, there were 970 violations approved by officers overseeing the program.

As more time passes, more accurate accident data will be generated but initial indications are that the cameras are slowing traffic down and reducing accidents.

**Update on July 31 at 12:00 a.m.**

The Sioux City Police Department has arrested 20-year-old Tyronn Mallory of Sioux City and charged him with attempted murder, willful injury, and going armed with intent in connection to this incident.

Mallory was taken into custody on July 30 at 9:00 p.m. by officers of Sioux City Police Department and booked into the Woodbury County Jail.

**Original Release on July 28 at 3:00 p.m.**

On July 28 at 6:43 a.m., the Sioux City Police Department responded to MercyOne after a 33-year-old male who was suffering from three gunshot wounds was dropped off by then unknown subjects who fled the area.

The victim was taken to surgery to treat his injuries before being able to provide a full statement to officers about the shooting.

Detectives with the Sioux City Police Department contacted the South Sioux City Police Department to assist in looking for the car that dropped the victim off at the hospital as it was described as driving into South Sioux City, Neb.

The vehicle was located a short time later at the Budget Inn, 1201 1st Ave South Sioux City, Neb., by the South Sioux City Police Department.

A search warrant was obtained to look for evidence of the shooting in the vehicle.

Based on statements made to detectives by subjects involved with the vehicle, it is believed the shooting may have occurred in the 400 block of 14th St. shortly before the victim was taken to MercyOne.

The victim of the shooting is still recovering from his injuries at MercyOne and has been unable to provide any further statement to detectives. His identity is not being released at this time.

A motive for the shooting is not known and no suspects have been identified.

Anyone with information on this matter is encouraged to call the Sioux City Police Department or Crime Stoppers at 258-TIPS (8477).

On June 27 at 5:00 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department responded to a report of a robbery that occurred at a gas station in the 4100 block of Floyd Blvd.

The adult-female victim of the robbery reported that she was putting gas in her car when a light blue Toyota Camry pulled up beside her vehicle. A man got out of the passenger side of the Toyota, approached the female, and demanded her belongings while displaying a gun. The woman initially struggled with the man until he started to become more aggressive. The suspect then got back into the Toyota and the car fled north on Floyd. The woman was not injured during the altercation.

A short time later, a report of shots being fired in the 5300 block of N. Cleveland Street was received. Involving a man in a light blue Toyota Camry.

Sioux City Police Officer responded and assisted the Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office in the investigation.

Officers determined that the suspect in the robbery on Floyd had pulled onto private property and discarded some of the items that were taken in the robbery. When the owner of the property confronted the subjects in the Toyota, the male in the passenger seat shot at the land owner. The land owner, who is an adult-male, was also armed and shot back at the suspect. No injuries were reported from the shooting.

Plymouth County Deputies located the Toyota over an hour after the shots fired call in the area of C80 and Highway 75. The car was unoccupied. They determined that a male and female had abandoned the car and got into a mid-2000’s silver Cadillac with a black top.

The suspect is described a lighter-skin tone black male, 6-foot-tall, with a slender build, and a goatee. The suspect remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous.

Anyone with information on this matter is encouraged to contact the Sioux City Police Department or the Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office.

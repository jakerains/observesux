The Sioux City Police Department has taken 34-year-old Juan Manuel Segovia of Sioux City into custody after a brief standoff at 912 21st Street on May 22, 2025.

Segovia had felony warrants for his arrest and was being sought by detectives when they saw him on the near-north side of the city at around 3:15 pm. Before he could be taken into custody, the detectives lost sight of him around the 900 block of 21st Street. It was soon determined that Segovia was at 912 21st Street.

A perimeter was established as Segovia is a known violent gang member who carries firearms. Officers attempted to call Segovia out of the house, but he refused to comply with those commands and would not communicate with officers. The SWAT Team was called out due to his history of violence and the potential of him having a firearm.

Once a search warrant for the house was obtained, and efforts to negotiate his peaceful surrender were exhausted, SWAT made entry into the house. Segovia was discovered hiding in the attic and surrendered once chemical agents were.

Segovia was assessed by medics for the chemical agent exposure but was not injured in the incident. No officers were hurt resolving this situation.

Segovia was booked into the Woodbury County Jail for two felony warrants for probation violation and a misdemeanor warrant for failure to comply with batterers education. No additional charges have been filed at this time but the investigation into Segovia is ongoing.

The Sioux City Police Department is dedicated to arresting violent felons and places the public’s safety as its highest priority. Efforts were made to resolve this matter peacefully. We are thankful that no one was injured and appreciate the neighborhood’s patience while we resolved this situation.

Officers identified 71-year-old David Biddle of Sioux City as the victim in the pedestrian accident on Dec. 1 at W. 4th and Bluff Streets.

We wish to express our sympathies to his family for their loss.

No charges have been filed against the driver of the SUV that struck Biddle.

Original Release on Dec. 1, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. - On Dec. 1, at 8:13 a.m., the Sioux City Police Department and Sioux City Fire and Rescue responded to a report of a pedestrian being struck at the intersection of W. 4th St. and Bluff St.

Officers found that an adult-male had been crossing the street at the intersection, stopped to pick something up in the street, and then was struck by a small SUV that had been traveling eastbound on W. 4th St.

The male victim was transported to MercyOne with critical injuries where he succumbed to his injuries a short time later. His name will not be released pending notification of his next of kin.

The SUV was operated by a juvenile-female who reported that she was not able to see the pedestrian due to the sun obscuring her vision.

Investigating officers are also looking for the occupants of white full-sized pick-up truck that had stopped shortly after the accident occurred and may be witnesses. It was occupied by two people who left before officers arrived on scene. The persons in this truck are asked to contact the Sioux City Police Department at 279-6960. (NOTE: This vehicle was located and officers have spoken to the occupants)

Based on witness accounts and available video evidence, it does not appear that the SUV involved was speeding.

The investigation into this accident is on-going at the time of this release.

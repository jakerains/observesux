On June 27 at 2:38 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department received a report of shots being fired in the 1800 block of Grandview Blvd.

Responding officers found an unoccupied van had been shot multiple times. No one was injured in the shooting.

The owner of the van stated her estranged common-law-husband had been there looking for the van and had contacted her looking for the keys, which she refused to give to him.

Witnesses provided a description of the suspect and the vehicle he fled in.

A short time later, law enforcement officers in South Dakota located the suspect car which had been described a white Ford Explorer and pursued it after it ran from a traffic stop.

After a pursuit involving North Sioux City Police, Elk Point Police, Union County Sheriff’s Office, and the South Dakota State Patrol, the suspect and the female driver were apprehended after tire deflation devices were used on the fleeing car.

Taken into custody were 41-year-old Anwar Maxwell and 30-year-old Tiana J. Maxey, both of Milwaukee, Wisc.

Maxey was charged in South Dakota on traffic charges related to the pursuit and booked into the Union County Jail.

Maxwell was brought to MercyOne in Sioux City for medical treatment after South Dakota State Patrol Trooper used less lethal rounds to subdue him and for an unknown medical complaint.

Once at MercyOne, the Sioux City Police Department assumed custody of Maxwell. He was booked into the Woodbury Count Jail for felon in possession of a firearm, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver cocaine, drug tax stamp violation, reckless use of a firearm, criminal mischief, and a warrant from Wisc.

Please contact the South Dakota State Patrol for further details on the pursuit in South Dakota.

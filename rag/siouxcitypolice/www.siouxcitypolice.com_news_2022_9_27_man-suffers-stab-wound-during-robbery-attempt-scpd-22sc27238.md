On September 25 at about 1:56 pm, Sioux City Police Officers were sent to the area of 7th & Courts St in Sioux City for a report of a man bleeding.

Officers located an adult-male that was suffering from a severe but non-life-threatening laceration to his head. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment.

The investigation determined that the victim had gone to a residence in the 1100 block of 7th St. to speak with someone that lived there. When the victim left the house, Hamilton Veliz-Cantor who been staying at the residence, began following him.

Veliz-Cantor, who was armed with a kitchen knife, confronted the victim, demanded money, and then cut the victim with the knife after he said he did not have any money.

Officers located Veliz-Cantor at his residence and took him into custody.

Detectives have charged 24-year-old Hamilton Veliz-Cantor with going armed with intent, 1st degree robbery, and willful injury.

They are also working with the Department of Homeland Security as Veliz-Cantor has previously been deported at least once and illegally returned to the country.

_Any arrest/charge noted in this report should be considered merely an accusation. Any defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty._

On Aug. 28 at 10:27 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department received a report of a pick-up truck that had lost control while traveling south on I29 at about mile marker 150 and drove into the Missouri River.

Responding officers located where the vehicle went into the river and found that the vehicle was fully submerged.

Sioux City Fire & Rescue and the Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 1 Dive Team began efforts to retrieve the vehicle from the water but were unsuccessful during the overnight hours due to conditions.

On Aug. 29 recovery efforts resumed and at 11:21 a.m., divers were successful in recovering the truck from the water.

The remains of the driver were recovered in the vehicle and a positive identification has been made and we are in contact with his family.

Officers identified 69-year-old Gerald M. Reed of Smithland, Iowa as the driver of the pick-up truck that died after his vehicle went into the Missouri river on Aug. 28 near mile marker 150.

We want to express our condolences to his family for their loss.

This accident is under investigation but it appears that the weather was a factor as this accident occurred during a period of heavy rain.

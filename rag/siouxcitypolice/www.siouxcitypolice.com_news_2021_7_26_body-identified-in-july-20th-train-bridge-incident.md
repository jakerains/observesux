On July 20 at 12:04 p.m., an individual was seen walking across the train bridge connecting Sioux City to South Sioux City. The person was witnessed falling into the river near the Iowa side. It is unclear as to whether the person fell, or intentionally jumped off the bridge.

Sioux City Fire Rescue and the South Sioux City Fire Department scrambled search and rescue boats to locate the person, to no avail.

On July 23 at 9:30 a.m., a boater discovered a body floating in the river about one mile north of Dakota City, Nebraska. Sioux City Fire Rescue recovered a body that matched the description from the incident on the train bridge on the July 20.

The body has been identified as 32-year-old Timmy Nawanna of Sioux City. We want to express our condolences to the Nawanna family.

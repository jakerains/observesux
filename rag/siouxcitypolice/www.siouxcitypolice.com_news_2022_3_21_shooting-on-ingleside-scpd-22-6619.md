On March 17, detectives charged 21-year-old Carlos D. Mejia of Sioux City with attempted murder, willful jury, and intimidation with a dangerous weapon for the shooting that occurred on March 14 at 1923 Ingleside.

Mejia had arranged for the adult-female victim to come to his residence to get money from him to use for the purchase of methamphetamine. When the victim arrived, she sent another woman to the door to get the money and Meija sent her away and asked for the victim.

When the victim came to the door, Mejia beckoned her inside where he was waiting in the kitchen. When she entered the back entry, Mejia had a gun in hand fired one bullet as she tried to flee. The victim suffered a gunshot wound to her abdomen which she sought medical treatment for. She is recovering at home. Mejia was booked into the Woodbury County Jail.

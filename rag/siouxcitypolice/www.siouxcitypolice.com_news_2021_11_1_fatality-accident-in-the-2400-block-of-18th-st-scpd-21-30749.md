**Original Release on Oct. 18, 2021 at 11:20 a.m.**\- The Sioux City Police Department responded to a single vehicle accident in the 2800 block of 18th Street this morning at 8:08 a.m. Upon arriving at the location, officers found that a commercial vehicle had veered off the roadway and into a grouping of trees. The driver was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Officers spoke with a witness who reported the vehicle traveling westbound when it crossed into the oncoming lane and ultimately left the roadway. It doesn't appear the driver made an attempt to stop the vehicle or correctively steer back onto the road.

The cause of the accident remains under investigation, but is potentially related to a medical issue.

The driver's name will not be released at this time pending notification of next of kin.

**Update on Oct. 19, 2021 at 3:30 p.m.** \- The Sioux City Police Department identified 43-year-old Ryan L. Palmer of Sibley, Iowa as the victim of the single-car fatality accident yesterday in the 2400 block of 18th St.

We want to express our condolences to his family for their loss.

Accident investigators are waiting on a determination from the Woodbury County Medical Examiner’s report to determine if there were any medical issues or substances that contributed to this accident.

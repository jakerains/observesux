The Sioux City Police Department encourages community involvement and desires our resident’s help in directing the efforts of their police department.  As such, we are requesting our residents take the opportunity to complete the police department’s on-line survey.  The survey should only take about 5 minutes to complete.

The survey can be taken by entering the following web address into any web browser or by scanning the QR code.

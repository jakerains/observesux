## February 14, 2022 [Jeremy McClure](https://www.siouxcitypolice.com/news?author=5c6dc3cedb792698ae90a839)

On February 14 at 12:54 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department received reports of shots being fired at Riverside Blvd. and W. 19th St. in Sioux City.

Responding officers did not locate any victims of a shooting as all subjects involved had fled the area.

Officers canvassed the area and were able to locate shell casings and security camera video of the vehicles involved.

It appears at this time that the incident started in the 2400 block of Riverside Blvd., when an unidentified subject possibly in a late 2000s Nissan Versa fired several shots at another unknown subject in a newer dark gray Ford Escape.

Both cars left that area and traveled south on Riverside Blvd when the Ford Escape stopped at the intersection with W. 19th, exited his vehicle, and fired shots at the Nissan.

Both cars fled eastbound on W. 19th St. before officers arrived.

At the time of this release, no one has come forward as being a victim of the shooting. Officers did not locate any property that appeared to have been struck by bullets.

Officers are looking for a newer dark gray Ford Escape driven by a white male possibly with a beard and a light gray or white 2000’s Nissan Versa hatchback that is missing hubcaps on the passenger side.

Anyone involved in this or who had information on the identity of these subjects are asked to call the Sioux City Police Department at 279-6960.

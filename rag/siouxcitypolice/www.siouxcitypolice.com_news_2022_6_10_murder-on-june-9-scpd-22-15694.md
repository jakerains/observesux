**Update on June 13 at 10:45 am** \- The name of the victim of the murder in the 500 block of 9th St on June 9 is 32-year-old Dolorean N. Wade of Sioux City.

We wish to express out condolences to his family and friends for their loss.

**Original Release on June 10 at 7:45 am -** On June 9 at 9:01 pm, the Sioux City Police Department responded to a report of a shooting at 516 9th St. and responding officers located an adult-male suffering from a gunshot wound.

The man was transported to MercyOne for treatment and died a short time later.

Initially Katrina Barnes, the girlfriend of the victim who also shared the residence with him, stated that the victim had been outside of their residence and stated he had been shot outside.

Detectives conducted a search of the residence and determined that Barnes and the victim had been arguing during the day and he had left before the shooting. When he returned and started pounding on the front door, Barnes fired a shot through the door striking the victim.

It was also determined that Barnes and another adult-female present waited 12 minutes to call 911.

Detectives have charged 32-year-old Katrina L. Barnes of Sioux City with 2nd degree murder, possession of a controlled substance, and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.

Detectives have also charged 25-year-old Jordyn R. Easton of Sioux City with accessory after the fact for failing to call 911 and concealing evidence related to the crime.

We are not releasing the name of the victim until 24 hours after the family of the victim have been notified.

This is on-going investigation.

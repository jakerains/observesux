# [Guidance on the new ATV/UTV law effective July 1](https://www.siouxcitypolice.com/news/2022/6/30/guidance-on-the-new-atvutv-law-effective-july-1)

Iowa House file 2130 regarding ATV’s and UTV’s will be effective this Friday July 1st. The bill legalizes the use of these vehicles on a **limited** number of roadways. The SCPD wanted to provide some guidance to citizens to facilitate legal operation these vehicles on the appropriate roadways in the corporate limits of Sioux City.

The amended Iowa Code section 321I.10(3) for ATV/UTV usage allows cities to regulate operation of such vehicles on two-lane primary and secondary road extensions. Highways greater than 2 lanes **are not** available for ATV/UTV use, regardless of location in the city or county.

The only roads in Sioux City where ATV/UTV usage is legal based on the amended laws will be the following:

- K29 – Old Lakeport Road, South of Derocher Path


- D18 – Correctionville Road, East of Camp High Hopes


- D25 – Old Hwy 141, Southeast of the entrance to the cemetery.


- ATV/UTV operation on other streets is not permitted, and a violation carries a fine of $70.00.


Individuals who choose to operate ATV’s or UTV’s on these approved roadways must also comply with these restrictions:

- Driver of the ATV/UTV must be at least 18 years of age and have financial liability coverage in effect for the vehicle and carry proof of such financial liability coverage (insurance)

- The ATV/UTV shall display lighted headlamps at all times while the vehicle is operated on the highway.


As indicated, this new law allows local cities to regulate usage in addition to current state laws. Sioux City currently has no ordinances that either restrict or allow ATV/UTV usage on Sioux City streets beyond what is indicated above in the new state law.

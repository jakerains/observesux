On Sept. 20 at 3:18 a.m., the Sioux City Police Department responded to a report of a subject damaging cars parked next to an apartment building in the 1000 block of Pierce St.

Officers arrested 30-year-old Hagos T. Mengsteab of Sioux City and charged him with 8 counts of 4th degree criminal mischief after they determined that he had broken windows and dented parked cars by throwing rocks at them.

Mengsteab, who showed signs of intoxication, was involved in an argument with an unknown male and then started damaging the cars. The other male was not involved in causing any damage and was not charged in this matter.

The initial estimate of total damage caused is to be $2,800.

_Any arrest/charge noted in this report should be considered merely an accusation. Any defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty_

On September 1 at 4:48 a.m., the Sioux City Police Department responded to a report of a skateboarder being struck by a vehicle in the Northbound lane at 2400 S. Lewis Blvd.

A teenaged-male was struck and was transported to the hospital with life-threatening injuries and has since passed away due to his injuries.

Initial information gathered was that the juvenile was riding a skateboard in the middle of the road and the driver was unable to avoid a collision due to the lack of time from observation of seeing the juvenile combined with the darkness of the roadway at that time of day.

SCPD Traffic Investigators were called out to the scene. This investigation is still on-going.

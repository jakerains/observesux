On October 20th, 2024, at approximately 7:22 pm an adult female contacted 911 dispatchers, indicating that she had been approached by a male party the 2600 block of Correctionville Road. The male had loaded a pistol and displayed it in a threatening manner before leaving towards Correctionville Road.

Officers were dispatched to the area and located a male party matching the description walking near Leech Avenue and South Fairmont Street. When confronted by officers, the suspect began walking away and pulled a firearm from his pocket. After being ordered to stop and to drop the gun, the suspect ran from officers. During the foot pursuit, the suspect shot at officers.  An officer returned fire. The suspect continued to flee towards the Greenville area where officers lost sight of him.

Additional law enforcement officers from the Sioux City Police Department and Woodbury County Sheriff’s Department responded to the area. A perimeter was established to limit the suspect’s movement. SCPD public information officers put out messages on social media and worked with local media outlets to request Greenville area residents shelter in place until the event could be resolved.

An incident command post was established and the SCPD SWAT Team was mobilized to begin a search of the area for the suspect. Based on information obtained during the investigation, officers searched 2519 East 1st Street. The suspect was located hiding in a crawl space on the second floor of the house. The suspect refused multiple commands to surrender. SWAT officers fired upon the suspect when he appeared to be reaching for his weapon.

Once the suspect was subdued, officers immediately began lifesaving measures. The 42-year-old suspect was transported to MercyOne Medical Center with a life-threatening injury. At the time of this release, the suspect was in critical condition. No officers were injured by gunfire during this incident.

The Sioux City Police Department contacted the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation to investigate the incident. Per department policy, involved officers will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Charges are pending on the suspect.

At this time, his name is not being released.

UPDATE Oct. 20, 2024 - The individual involved in the officer involved shooting is Jamie Orozco of Sioux City. Following the incident Orozco was transported to Mercy One for initial care, and then transported to Omaha Nebraska for advanced medical treatment. He is currently in critical condition. The incident began on Sunday, October 20th when Orozco was being sought in relation to a citizen who had been threatened with a firearm. When officers located Orozco, he produced a handgun, fled on foot, and fired at officers. He was later located by SWAT officers hiding in a residence on 1st Street where an officer involved shooting occurred.

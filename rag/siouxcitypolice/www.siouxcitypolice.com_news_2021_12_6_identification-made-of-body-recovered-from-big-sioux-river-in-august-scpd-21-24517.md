On Aug 21 at 6:05 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department responded to a report of a body being found in the Big Sioux River.

Due to the state of decay of the remains, detectives had to seek the assistance of the State Crime Lab and to use DNA to make a positive identification.

On Dec. 2, the lab notified the department that the person was positively identified as 24-year-old Franky Muritok of Sioux City.

We wish to express our sympathies to his family for their loss.

Muritok was reported missing on Aug. 15 after he had left to take his dog for a walk and did not return home. His dog was located tied up next to the river.

At this time, there is no indication of foul play and Muritok’s death appears to be accidental.

On evening of Dec. 29, five law enforcement agencies conducted a traffic enforcement project focusing on I29 in Woodbury County.

The Dept. of Public Safety Motor Vehicle Enforcement, Iowa State Patrol, Sergeant Bluff Police Department, Sioux City Police Department, and Woodbury County Sheriff’s Office participated in the project.

During the project, 135 cars were stopped for various violations in total with 54 cars being stopped for speeding. In all, 187 citations were issued, and 146 warnings were given.

Arrests were made for an outstanding warrant, possession of 4 grams of methamphetamine, and 20 grams of marijuana.

A highlight of the evening was that none of the drivers stopped were impaired from drugs or alcohol in violation of Iowa’s operating while intoxicated law.

These multi-agency projects are an effort to increase safety for those traveling on I29.

**Hello and welcome to the Sioux City Police Department's website.**

**Our nationally-accredited department is made up of 131 sworn officers and 25 civilian personnel. Our department mission emphasizes our ability to work in partnership with the community through community policing, outreach efforts, and establishing strong partnerships with the citizens we serve.**

**We are extremely proud of the progressive programs we have established to allow our officers and staff the ability to better serve our diverse and growing community. We encourage community involvement and hope that our citizens take the opportunity to help direct the efforts of their police department. Our goal is not only responding to and suppressing crime, but helping improve the quality of life for all residents.**

**Our officers are empowered to seek ways to better serve our community and provide the highest level of professional service. We are very proud of our beautiful city, and invite every member of our community to get personally acquainted with the officers that serve them on a day to day basis. I truly believe that you will be impressed at the dedication and professionalism of every member of our progressive and diverse agency.**

**Thank you for visiting.**

**_\-\- Chief Rex Mueller, Sioux City Police Department_**

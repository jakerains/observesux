Released on Feb. 22, 2025 at 6:30 a.m. - On Saturday February 22, 2023, at approximately 3:38 AM officers with the Sioux City Police Department initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle near 18th and Grandview Blvd. During the stop, officers learned an occupant of the vehicle was wanted for felony criminal warrants. As officers attempted to take the wanted individual into custody, the suspect resisted arrest, and an officer discharged their firearm. Officers immediately initiated lifesaving measures to care for the injured suspect, who was later transported to a local hospital for treatment. The suspect’s condition is not currently available.

The Sioux City Police Department contacted the Iowa DCI to investigate the incident. The Iowa State Patrol also assisted in the investigation. Per department policy, involved officers were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Further information will be released at the conclusion of the investigation.

One person has been identified and charged in connection to the arson at the Esquire Club (also known as the After Set), 414 W. 7th St.

Detectives have charged 36-year-old Valon Jackson of Sioux City with 2nd degree arson, 1st degree criminal mischief, and 3rd degree burglary.

On Aug. 22 at 8:18 a.m., Sioux City Fire & Rescue responded to the club after reports of a fire were received.

The fire department determined that the cause of the fire was arson and a total estimate of the damage is not known but it is estimated to be over $20,000.

Jackson, along with an unidentified male, forced a door open and set the fire.

The motivation for the arson appears to be animosity towards the club.

Initial descriptions of the second suspect were of a black male but video evidence obtained shows a white male with Jackson.

The investigation into this matter is on-going.

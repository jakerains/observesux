Update July 31 at 8:00 a.m.

Investigating officers identified 37-year-old Doua Lor of Sioux City as the victim of the fatal accident.

We wish to express our sympathy to her family for their loss.

The investigation into this accident is on-going and no charges have been filed at the time of this release.

Original release on July 30 at 8:30 a.m.

On July 29 at 11:35 p.m., the Sioux City Police Department and Sioux City Fire & Rescue responded to a report of a single car roll-over accident at 17th and Main St in Sioux City.

Responding officers found that a 2001 Chevy Tahoe had been traveling westbound on 17th St. when it lost control at the intersection with Main St., slid off the roadway, and rolled over, coming to rest on its side on the side of the road.

An adult female passenger was thrown from the vehicle and died as a result of her injuries. Her name will not be release until 24 hours after notification of her next of kin.

Two other adult male passengers, one in the front seat who was wearing a seat belt and one in the backseat who was not wearing a seat belt, were treated for apparent minor injuries.

The adult female driver, who was wearing a seat belt, had to be extricated from the vehicle and was also treated for apparent minor injuries.

The initial investigation into the accident indicates that speed was a factor. The possibility of a mechanical issue with the brakes as well as the use of drugs or alcohol by the driver is part of an on-going investigation into the accident.

_Corrections: the initial release stated both adult males involved in the accident were not wearing seat belts and the vehicle came to rest on its side and not its roof._

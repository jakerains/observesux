## December 15, 2021 [Jeremy McClure](https://www.siouxcitypolice.com/news?author=5c6dc3cedb792698ae90a839)

On Dec. 12 at 3:24 p.m. in the 4000 block of Morningside Ave., officers with the Sioux City Police Department took 37-year-old Casey Andersen into custody on warrants issued for his arrest.

While arresting Andersen, officers noticed that not only did he match the description of a suspect who took packages off of a front porch in the 2200 block of S. Olive St. on Dec. 9, but he was also wearing the exact same clothes at the time of his arrest. This determination was based on doorbell camera footage provided by the victim of the theft.

Officers booked Andersen into Woodbury County Jail for his warrants and also charged him with the Dec. 9 theft.

Further investigations into Andersen have connected him to an additional theft of packages on Dec. 8 in the 5000 block of Glenn Ave and charges have been referred to the Woodbury County Attorney's Office in that matter.

The doorbell camera footage provide was very valuable in connecting Andersen to these thefts. We encourage victims of package thefts to report the thefts and thank neighbors willing to provide valuable video evidence.

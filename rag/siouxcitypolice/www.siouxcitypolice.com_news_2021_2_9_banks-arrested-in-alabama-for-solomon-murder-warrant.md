Prichard, Ala. - Members of the Gulf Coast Fugitive Task Force took into custody 36-year-old Roderick D. Banks on Feb. 8 in Prichard, Ala. without incident.

Banks had a warrant for his arrest charging him with the Nov. 1 murder of Solomon Blackbird in Sioux City, Iowa.

Blackbird was found suffering from a gunshot wound in the 2600 block of Douglas St. on Nov. 1 at 6:46 p.m. He was transported to MercyOne where he succumbed to his wound. The motive is possibly related to a drug deal between the two men.

Detectives with the Sioux City Police Department notified the Northern Iowa Fugitive Task Force of Bank’s warrant and sought their assistance in apprehending him.

Based on their investigation and tips received, the Northern Iowa Fugitive Task Force developed information that Banks had fled to Alabama in order to avoid prosecution and notified the Gulf Coast Fugitive Task Force in order to locate and apprehend Banks.

Banks is awaiting extradition back to Sioux City.

The Fugitive Task Force is under the control of the U.S. Marshal Service and the local task force includes a member of the Sioux City Police Department.

The purpose of the regional fugitive task forces is to combine the efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to locate and apprehend the most dangerous fugitives and assist in high profile investigations.

The department’s partnership with the U.S. Marshal Service helps ensure that fugitives that commit violent acts in Sioux City are held accountable for their actions no matter where they try to flee and hide.

_Any arrest/charge noted in this report should be considered merely an accusation. Any defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty._

Detectives with the Sioux City Police Department arrested three people on Aug. 20 in connection to several burglaries of homes and cars in the Morningside area of Sioux City that occurred during the month of August.

The suspects were identified using home security camera footage that was posted to social media by one of the victims.

Arrested were 18-year-old Andrew M. Squibb of Sioux City who was charged with five counts of 3rd degree burglary, two counts of 2nd degree theft, two counts of 5th degree theft, and three counts of 4th degree criminal mischief.

A 17-year-old male was also arrested and charged with four counts of 3rd degree burglary, two counts of 2nd degree theft, two counts of 5th degree theft, and three counts of 4th degree criminal mischief.

18-year-old Sarah R. Jordan of Sioux City was charged with 2nd degree theft for possessing stolen firearms.

Detectives served a search warrant on the residence and cars of the arrested parties and located several stolen items to include three rifles, a shotgun, a handgun, ammunition, and other items stolen in the burglaries.

Although the video footage that was captured showed the arrested persons hiding their faces, other information such as clothing and audio proved very beneficial in identifying the people involved and the clothing they wore. We would like to thank everyone that provided video footage and helped with this and other investigations.

There is an on-going investigation into other burglaries and thefts these subjects may have been involved in.

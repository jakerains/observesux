On April 23 at 8:39 pm, officers were dispatched to the Sav A Lot, 1730 Pierce St., for a report of an adult-male suffering a life-threatening stab wound to his arm.

Officers were able to determine that the location of the stabbing occurred in the 1700 block of Pierce St.

Detectives were unable to speak to the victim initially as he was receiving medical treatment but were able to interview him on the 24th of April.

Based on their investigation, 34-year-old Joseph D. McCauley of Sioux City was booked into the Woodbury County Jail on charges of attempted murder, going armed with intent, use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of a crime, felon in possession of ammunition, and felony possession of drugs.

McCauley and the victim knew each other and the stabbing was motivated over a disagreement of some sort.

_Any arrest/charge noted in this report should be considered merely an accusation. Any defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty._

Officers responded to a report of a suspicious subject on Dec. 26th at 4:15 a.m. in the 6200 block of Tiger Ave in the Whispering Creek area of town after a homeowner was alerted to someone triggering his security camera.

When Officers arrived in the area, they located 39-year-old Charles C. Gordon of Sioux City hiding under a pickup truck parked in the street near the residence.

The camera footage showed Gordon checking car handles in the homeowner’s driveway before making his way to the garage of the home. Gordon then entered the garage and took items from a car parked inside. The items he took from the home were recovered in the truck that he had been hiding under.

Detectives were called in to continue the investigation and connected Gordon to four other burglaries that he had committed previously during October and December.

Gordon was charged with 2nd degree burglary for entering the residence, and four counts of 3rd degree burglary of a motor vehicle.

Officers with the Sioux City Police Department assisted Sioux City Animal Control in the execution of a search warrant to remove numerous exotic snakes and feeder mice that were being raised in a Sioux City home on July 11 shortly after 10 pm.

Officers were called to a home in the 4600 block of Harrison St. after a neighbor complained of finding a boa constrictor and feeder mice in his house.

Animal Control removed the animals and are caring for them at the Sioux City Animal Adoption and Rescue Center.

The home-owner was not at home at the time of the removal.

The matter has been referred to the City of Sioux City Legal Department for consideration of appropriate charges.

This is an on-going investigation.
